The <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php">United States Geological Survey</a>, or USGS for short, 
is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, 
the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. 
Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful 
information about the Earth and its processes.<br>
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their 
earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but 
they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing 
a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government 
organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.
<p>

The instructions for this activity are broken into two parts:

- Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization<br>
- Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data
